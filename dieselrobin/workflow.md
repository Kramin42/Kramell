# Workflow

## Registration

If you have organised a team with two other players then go to the IRC channel [##dieselrobin](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##dieselrobin) on freenode (feel free to use a better IRC client) and enter the command:

	$signup <team name>
	$signup "DON'T LABEL ME"

If you don't have a team and want to be randomly assigned to one, then tell Kramin (ping me in [##dieselrobin](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##dieselrobin) or [##dieselrobin](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##crawl)) before the 17th of Jan. On the 17th all the teamless people will be randomly grouped into teams.
Then you can procede as above.

## Pre tournament

### Combo nomination

Everyone must nominate a combo before the start of the tourney (0 AM the 24th of Jan UTC), these combos will be shuffled and distributed to the teams.

Nominate a combo in [##dieselrobin](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##dieselrobin) with:

	$nominate <combo>
	$nominate DgWn

## Tournament Time

### Making a robin account and choosing bonus missions

* Each team will be given 3 combos at the start of the tourney
* Each player must pick which combo they will start with.
* Teams must assign all bonus missions before playing, one of each tier to each combo.

Once you are organised, each player must make an ALLCAPS account on a server (suggested password: robin) and assign their combo to it with:

	$assign <combo> <account> <bonus mission choice>
	$assign DEMo DEEPELFMONK ABC

The "ABC" here means mission A from Tier 1, mission B from Tier 2, and mission C from Tier 3. Change that to the missions you arranged to do with your team.

### Missions

**Regular**

When you complete a mission it will be announced in [##dieselrobin](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##dieselrobin) by the bot, Kramell. 
Kramell will also tell you which mission to do next and whose turn it is to play next.
For this reason it is best you stay connected to [##dieselrobin](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##dieselrobin) while you are playing.

To check mission details in ##dieselrobin, use the command `$mission <num>`.

**Bonus**

These are announced similarly to regular missions. You can use the command `$bonus` to see your team's progress through them.

## Wrapping up

Once the tournament is closed, 1st, 2nd and 3rd place 'awards' will be given out.
